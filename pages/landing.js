                                <p>IT ALL STARTED IN . . . 2013 taking place in a small caf√© shop to figure out the perception of blockchain. The cryptocurrency Bitcoin was thought of as a joke by many people. However, the core believed this technology could change the world as we know it. The team quickly noticed there was no real place or group that represented the blockchain community. Their idea was to build a strong blockchain community that was well connected. This eventually lead to lots of ideas that were being explored amongst many blockchain enthusiasts.</p>
